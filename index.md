I completed a postdoctoral research fellowship at the Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science in the Department of Population Health at [NYU School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/chids/home). I got a PhD in Health Care Management and Economics at the [Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania](https://hcmg.wharton.upenn.edu/). Prior to entering the doctoral program, I was a research fellow at [Stanford Law School](https://law.stanford.edu/empirical-research-fellowship/) working on public economics research.
